# Diet Logs

*Spring Boot 2.0 REST API*

The dietitian can add their clients. For each client the dietitian can add measurements, mainly they weight for that measurement. The BMI is added automatically. The dietitian can also schedule the next appointment for each client, the appointment's date is after the current date.

The UI will be done in Angular and be hosted in a different repository.
